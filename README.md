**Chat Interface Java Program**
This chat interface in Java makes use of Java GUI and implements an automated chatbot with login, password and standard message instructions. The program is written in Java and uses the AWT and Swing libraries for the user interface.

**Features**: 
• Users can log in with a username and password.
• Users can send messages to the chatbot and receive responses.
• The chatbot can handle specific keywords and phrases, as well as respond to general topics through a keyword matching algorithm.
• The program also supports sending files, creating and joining groups, and searching through chat history.

**How to use:**
•Run the program by executing the ChatInterfaceJavaProgram class.
̐• Enter a username and password to log in.
• Type a message into the input field and press the "Send" button or press Enter to send the message.
• The chatbot will respond to the message and the conversation will be displayed in the chat area.
• To exit the program, press the "Exit" button or close the window.

**Limitations:**
• The current implementation of the program does not include any actual file sending or group creation/joining functionality.
• The program also does not have any real authentication or user management system in place.
• The keyword matching algorithm is very basic and may not accurately identify relevant topics.
• The program also does not support additional features like editing or deleting messages, or changing the appearance of the interface.

**Future Improvements:**
• Implement actual file sending and group creation/joining functionality.
• Add a real authentication and user management system.
• Improve the keyword matching algorithm to better identify relevant topics.
• Add additional features like editing or deleting messages, or changing the appearance of the interface.
